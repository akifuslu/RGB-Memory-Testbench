# RGB-Memory-Testbench
Testbench for the homework 4 of Ceng232 (2019')

## Running the testbench
First, make sure the software is in "Simulation" mode and not the "Implementation" mode.
Then,
+ Use "Add Copy Of Source" option in the left pane in Xilinx ISE, and select the rgb_testbench.v file.
Then:
+ Select the rgb_testbench.v file from the left pane.
+ Click ISIM Simulator in the left pane.
    + Click "Behavioral check syntax". This is where you see if your code has syntax errors, indicated at the bottom pane.
    + If syntax check is successful, click "Simulate Behavioral Model". This should open a new window, with console outputs at the bottom, and the timing diagram at "Default.wcfg".
